Data extracted directly from "https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/cycle_gan"

This can be directly loaded in the program by executing the below code. This code is used in both in training and evaluation code.

import tensorflow_datasets as tfds
dataset, metadata = tfds.load('cycle_gan/horse2zebra',
                              with_info=True, as_supervised=True)

train_horses, train_zebras = dataset['trainA'], dataset['trainB']
test_horses, test_zebras = dataset['testA'], dataset['testB']
